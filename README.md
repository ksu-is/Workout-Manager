# Workout-Manager
Workout Manager is designed with the idea of managing and tracking different workouts. It is able to track different things such as how many repetitions to perform, how many sets to do, the muscle group it hits, and instructions on how to perform the workout properly. Workout Manager will be able to function with GUI and Flask as a web application.
